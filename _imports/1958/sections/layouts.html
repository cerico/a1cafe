    <h2>Keyboard Layouts and Controls</h2>
    <p>Essential keyboarding functions are controlled by nine finger-tip switches on the keyboard panel:</p>
    <p>The <kbd>Punch On</kbd> switch controls the operation of the code punch mechanism. When locked int the down position an individual code is punched for every character or function. The <kbd>Tape Feed</kbd> switch runs tape throught the punch without coding. Standard practice is to begin and end every tape with blank sections that can be written for identification or production instructions. The <kbd>Code Delete</kbd> switch is used to cancel any incorrect codes in the tape. The <kbd>Start Read</kbd> switch is used in cutting duplicate tapes semi-automatically, or for corrections and added material. The <kbd>Non Justify</kbd> switch insures uniform word spacing for both non-justified and justified composition. When in the down position it permits only non-justified composition. The <kbd>Stop Read</kbd> switch is used in conjunction with the Start Read switch. The <kbd>Stop Code</kbd> switch enters a code to halt the automatic operation of the Photographic Unit for monitor attention. The <kbd>Line Delete</kbd> switch is used to cancel incorrect lines or portions of lines. It is usually the simplest and fastest method in-process correction. The <kbd>J-Car Return</kbd> switch is used to simultaneously record justification, line space, and carriage return codes for automatic operation of the Photographic Unit. It also line spaces and mechanically returns the carriage of the Keyboard Unit. The <em>Indicating Light</em> in the center of the panel signals when justification of a line is possible. Automatic justification is on a word space basis. Plus and minus letter spacing is also possible in fixed increments.</p>
