          <h2>Model B Typesetter <em>Keyboard Unit</em></h2>
          <p>This is the production control center of the Model B Typesetter. It punches the coded tape that carries all control data for high-speed automated typesetting. It simultaneously types a compositor’s proof for fast detection and correction of errors, before photosetting.</p>
          <p>The control tape captures all the labor and skill of composition. Tapes can be filed, re-run, edited, revised, added to, merged, even mailed to operated remote Typesetter photographic units.</p>
          <p>Keyboard speed, and the typographic quality of Typesetter composition, are limited only the compositor’s skill. The Keyboard is mechanically faster than any operator. In semi-automatic operation the within-line rate of speed is approximately 600 character and function codes per minute.</p>

          <h2>Model B Typesetter <em>Photographic Unit</em></h2>
          <p>This is the quality control center of the Model B Typesetter. Under automatic coded tape control it produces flawless reproductions of original type desings: smear-proof, uniform in color, with no broken or pitted characters, no ragged edges or serifs, no chance of plugging or embossment. The developed image on photographic paper or film is ideal for all reproduction processes that use photomechanical plates.</p>
          <p>Maximum image quality is insured by a fixed, pre-focused optical system; by built-in voltage regulation for constant density of light; and by a grey-scale control disc for uniform development.</p>
          <p>Within-line photoraphic speed of the Model B approximates 330 codes per minute. In production figures this can produce ten 11-pica lines of 8½ point Century Schoolbook straight matter.</p>
